## Module Three: Secure data assignment

1 **List** what you can do at each of these stages to work safely with any data

- Where did we get it? (keep a record)
- What can we do with it? (licence / T&C)
- Is it any good? (data quality / footnotes / extreme numbers)
- Where are we keeping it? (and why?)
- Will we publish a dataset from it? (and why?)
- Any other steps

2 **Review** one or more of these cases of (primary) data gathered for journalism. The first two involve donated data, the third involves monitoring and the last collected the data from an [NHS search function](https://www.nhs.uk/service-search/find-a-dentist).

You don't have to provide evidence that you've looked at one or more of these stories (although you can). The goal here is to **see** some concrete examples of how journalists have collected data (some of it personal) for a story.

- [Deliveroo drivers earn as little as Â£2 an hour (TBIJ)](https://www.thebureauinvestigates.com/stories/2021-03-25/deliveroo-riders-earning-as-little-as-2-pounds) & [background](https://www.thebureauinvestigates.com/blog/2021-04-14/a-blueprint-for-investigative-journalism-how-the-bureau-worked-alongside-riders-to-investigate-deliveroo)

- [Black box Schufa (Spiegel)](https://www.spiegel.de/wirtschaft/service/schufa-so-funktioniert-deutschlands-einflussreichste-auskunftei-a-1239214.html) & [background](https://openschufa.de/english/)

- [Who gets to breath clean air in Delhi? (NYT)](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/12/17/world/asia/india-pollution-inequality.html) & [background](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/24/insider/india-measuring-pollution.html)

- [Patients 'glued own teeth' as dentists drop NHS work (BBC)](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-59874320) & [background](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oRvgeBzV5R62RLBOVRwZnSo-NMinzJ_jJbtKwtLU_Fc/edit#)

3 Having reviewed these stories, identify a possible source of data that you could collect. Decide **if** the collection would be legally and ethically safe - why (not)? The goal is not to find the ideal data collection project, but simply to test a hypothetical data collection idea: you might simply identify a possible collection project and explain why it won't work.

**Send** your material to Cambridge Spark, since they are tracking who's done what.

**What should my finished document look like?**
It should **not** run very long and there is no minimum word count: Question 1 is around half a dozen points or sentences. Question 2 doesn't require you to write anything (although you can submit your observations if you like). Question 3 is an outline of what your idea is and why it works / doesn't work so it could be two paragraphs or it could be a series of points.

The whole thing could conceivably be done in a single page, but there is no upper limit if you need to write more.
