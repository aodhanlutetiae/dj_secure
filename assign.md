## Module Three: Secure data assignment

1. **List** what you can do at each of these stages to work safely with any data

- Where did we get it? (keep a record)
- What can we do with it? (licence / T&C)
- Is it any good? (data quality / footnotes / extreme numbers)
- Where are we keeping it? (and why?)
- Will we publish a dataset from it? (and why?)
- Any other steps


2. **Review** one or more of these cases of (primary) data gathered for journalism. The first two involve donated data, the third involves monitoring and the last collected the data from an NHS search function.

Identify a possible source of data that you could collect. Decide if the collection would be legally and ethically safe - why (not)?
