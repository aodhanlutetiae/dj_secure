## Module Three: Secure data assignment

1. Use a dataset of your own choice and outline what you can do at each of the following stages to work safely with the dataset

SOURCE
- keep a record
- check the licence or the T&C
- data quality & consistency / footnotes / extreme numbers

STORAGE
- test where it lives
- lock it if needs be

ANALYSIS
- layout (for us, and editors)
- Is the representation fair or loaded in any way?

2. Review these cases of (primary) data gathered for journalism. Then identify data you might. Assuming you want to collect your own data, what will you have to look out for?
